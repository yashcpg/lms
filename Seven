Great catch — the error you’re seeing is totally valid.

Your controller is trying to call this method:

_leaveRequestService.GetLeaveRequestsForEmployeeAsync(userId);

But that method hasn’t been defined yet in your LeaveRequestService. So let’s implement it (and also one for managers).


---

Step 1: Implement the missing methods in LeaveRequestService

// Get all leave requests submitted by a specific employee
public async Task<List<LeaveRequest>> GetLeaveRequestsForEmployeeAsync(string userId)
{
    return await _context.LeaveRequests
        .Where(lr => lr.UserId == userId)
        .OrderByDescending(lr => lr.CreatedAt)
        .ToListAsync();
}

// Get all leave requests submitted to a specific manager
public async Task<List<LeaveRequest>> GetLeaveRequestsForManagerAsync(string managerId)
{
    return await _context.LeaveRequests
        .Where(lr => lr.ManagerId == managerId || lr.Status == "Pending")
        .OrderByDescending(lr => lr.CreatedAt)
        .ToListAsync();
}

You may also want to Include() related entities (like LeaveType or User) if needed:

.Include(lr => lr.LeaveType)
.Include(lr => lr.User)


---

Step 2: Add required using directives at the top

Make sure you have these:

using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;


---

Now your controller calls like:

var leaveRequests = await _leaveRequestService.GetLeaveRequestsForEmployeeAsync(userId);

will work properly.

Would you like me to also help build DTOs so you don’t return full LeaveRequest models directly from the API?

Sure! Here's a clean and complete version of the LeaveRequestCreateDto:

using System;
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;

namespace lms.Dtos
{
    public class LeaveRequestCreateDto
    {
        [Required]
        public int LeaveTypeId { get; set; }

        [Required]
        [DataType(DataType.Date)]
        public DateTime StartDate { get; set; }

        [Required]
        [DataType(DataType.Date)]
        public DateTime EndDate { get; set; }

        [MaxLength(500)]
        public string Reason { get; set; }
    }
}

Notes:

LeaveTypeId: The type of leave the employee is applying for.

StartDate / EndDate: Dates for the leave request.

Reason: Optional, but it's good to include a reason field with a max length for clean data.


Let me know if you also want to create a LeaveRequestDto for returning leave request data in the response.
