Great! Let's start with Step 1: Models. I'll break down the models (entities) you'll need for the Leave Management System (LMS) based on the functional requirements you provided.

1. Models (Entities)

The models correspond to the data structure in your PostgreSQL database. We'll define the entities for User Authentication, Leave Types, Leave Requests, Leave Balances, and Notifications.

Here are the models:


---

a. ApplicationUser (extends IdentityUser)

The ApplicationUser class will extend IdentityUser to support the authentication and user management via ASP.NET Core Identity.

public class ApplicationUser : IdentityUser
{
    [Required]
    public string FullName { get; set; }
    
    [Required]
    public string Department { get; set; }
    
    public string ManagerId { get; set; }  // FK to ApplicationUser for reporting manager
    
    [NotMapped]
    public string Role { get; set; }  // Store the role here for convenience, not part of the DB
}

FullName: Employee's full name.

Department: Department of the employee (e.g., HR, Engineering, Sales).

ManagerId: Optional foreign key pointing to another ApplicationUser, representing the manager. This is nullable as not all employees will have a manager assigned initially.

Role: Not mapped directly to the database, as roles are handled by Identity, but it could be helpful in certain scenarios.



---

b. LeaveType

The LeaveType model stores different leave types an employee can apply for.

public class LeaveType
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    [Required]
    public string Name { get; set; }  // Example: Sick Leave, Casual Leave, etc.
    
    public string Description { get; set; }  // Optional description
    
    public int DefaultDays { get; set; }  // Default number of days allocated for this leave type
    
    public bool IsPaid { get; set; }  // Whether this leave is paid or unpaid
}

Name: Name of the leave type (e.g., Sick Leave, Paid Leave, etc.).

Description: Optional field to describe the leave type.

DefaultDays: Default days allocated for this leave type per year (can be configured per policy).

IsPaid: Whether the leave type is paid or unpaid.



---

c. LeaveBalance

The LeaveBalance model tracks how many days of each leave type an employee has remaining.

public class LeaveBalance
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    
    public string UserId { get; set; }  // FK to ApplicationUser (Employee)
    public ApplicationUser User { get; set; }  // Navigation property to ApplicationUser
    
    public int LeaveTypeId { get; set; }  // FK to LeaveType
    public LeaveType LeaveType { get; set; }  // Navigation property to LeaveType
    
    public int RemainingDays { get; set; }  // Number of leave days remaining
}

UserId: Foreign key to the ApplicationUser, identifying the employee.

LeaveTypeId: Foreign key to the LeaveType model, specifying which leave type the balance refers to.

RemainingDays: Number of days left for that specific leave type.



---

d. LeaveRequest

The LeaveRequest model represents an employeeâ€™s request for leave, which managers approve or reject.

public class LeaveRequest
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    
    public string UserId { get; set; }  // FK to ApplicationUser (Employee)
    public ApplicationUser User { get; set; }  // Navigation property to ApplicationUser
    
    public int LeaveTypeId { get; set; }  // FK to LeaveType
    public LeaveType LeaveType { get; set; }  // Navigation property to LeaveType
    
    public DateTime StartDate { get; set; }
    public DateTime EndDate { get; set; }
    
    public int TotalDays { get; set; }  // Total number of leave days requested
    
    public string Reason { get; set; }  // Reason for leave
    
    public string Status { get; set; }  // Pending, Approved, Rejected, Canceled
    
    public string ManagerId { get; set; }  // FK to ApplicationUser (Manager)
    public ApplicationUser Manager { get; set; }  // Navigation property to Manager
    
    public DateTime? DecisionDate { get; set; }  // Date when the manager approved/rejected the leave request
    
    public DateTime CreatedAt { get; set; }  // Date when the leave request was created
}

UserId: Foreign key to the employee who is requesting leave.

LeaveTypeId: Foreign key to the type of leave being requested (e.g., Sick Leave).

StartDate and EndDate: Dates for the leave period.

TotalDays: Total days calculated based on start and end dates.

Reason: Reason for the leave request.

Status: The current status of the leave (Pending, Approved, Rejected, Canceled).

ManagerId: FK to the manager who will approve/reject the leave.

CreatedAt: Timestamp of when the leave request was created.



---

e. Notification

The Notification model represents alerts sent to users about their leave requests or system events (e.g., new leave request, leave approved/rejected).

public class Notification
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    
    public string UserId { get; set; }  // FK to ApplicationUser (Employee or Manager)
    public ApplicationUser User { get; set; }  // Navigation property to ApplicationUser
    
    public string Message { get; set; }  // Message content (e.g., "Your leave request was approved.")
    
    public string Type { get; set; }  // Email or SMS
    
    public bool IsRead { get; set; }  // To mark if the notification has been read
    
    public DateTime CreatedAt { get; set; }  // Date when the notification was created
}

UserId: Foreign key to the user who will receive the notification.

Message: The actual notification content.

Type: The type of notification (e.g., Email, SMS).

IsRead: Flag indicating whether the notification has been read.

CreatedAt: Timestamp for when the notification was created.

2. Next Steps:

After defining these models, the next step will be to set up your DbContext and configure the necessary relationships between these models using Entity Framework Core.

Would you like to proceed with creating the DbContext for these models next?
